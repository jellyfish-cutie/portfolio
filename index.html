    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am majoring in Computer Science at BYU with a minor in Business.
        My taste buds are obsessed with limes and lemons.
        Personally, I believe most dishes will either taste good or better with these citrus fruits.
        I have only been skiing and snowboarding once even though I grew 20mins away from the mountains in Colorado. </p>
